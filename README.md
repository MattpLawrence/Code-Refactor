# GT-Code-Refactor

Homework number one for GT code camp. Completed by Matthew Lawrence.

## Host Location:
https://mattplawrence.github.io/GT-Code-Refactor/

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to refactor a complete website homepage to leave it in better semantic and syntactic form.
## Problem:
In this project I solved the problem of applying best practices to the format of both the HTML and CSS of a website landing page.

### The problems encountered include:
* Replacing nondescriptive div tabs with descriptive "semantic" tags in HTML.
* Ensure that all indentation is correct and aligned. Some indented open tags did not line up with their close tag.
* Add alternative messages for each image incase the image cannot load.
* Update CSS with the new semantic tags corresponding to the HTML.
* Re-order the CSS to follow the sequential order of HTML content. 
* Divide the CSS into logical and sequential sections.
* Condense CSS by chaining elements instead of setting definitions for each element.
* Comment individual CSS elements to describe what they do. (Heavy comments for the sake of this homework project.)

## What I learned:
I learned that there are a lot of nuances to code syntax, and that the longer I looked the more I found out of place. When comparing the finished, refactored code to the starting code, it became clear how important these seemingly small changes are.

## Preview:
The website landing page as written in this repository should look like the following image:
